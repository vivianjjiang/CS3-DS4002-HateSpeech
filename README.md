# CS3 DS 4002 - Context over Profanity: Hate Speech Identification 
## Overview 
This repository contains all materials for the Ds4002 Case Study focused on Hate Speech Identification using real Twitter (now known as X) data. Students will explore linguistic patterns, compare modeling approaches, and evaluate how context affects the detection of harmful speech. 
This case study is based on the CrowdFlower Hate Speech Identification Dataset, and adapated from Vivian Jiang's original DS4002 Project 1. 

## Hook and Rubric Documents:
The hook document outlining the case is included as CS3_Hook_HS.pdf. 
The Rubric CS3_Rubric_HS.pdf describes the task, submission requirements, formatting, and evaluation criteria for this assignment. 

**Use both documents continuously while completing the case study to ensure you meet expectations.**
## Data
This case study uses the **CrowdFlower Hate Speech Identification dataset**, which contains ~ 25,000 tweets labeled as hate speech, offensive language, or neither.

You can access the dataset here (MIT License):🔗 https://data.world/crowdflower/hate-speech-identification

Your job is to analyze linguistic patterns and build baseline + advanced classification models using this dataset. 
Processed and cleaned versions of the data may also be included in the data/ folder of this repository.
